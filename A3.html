            <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
            <h3> Question: What is the difference in the age distribution (i.e. population size by age group) by sex
                when comparing the two years
                (1900 and 2000)?</h3>

                Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to capture total population for each age group by sex and for both years</li>
                <li>Thought it could be interesting to do a graph similar to a population pyramid but comparing sex
                    between the two years ;
                    having males and females on the same age axis but comparing by year</li>
                <li><b>Worked well</b>: showing total population size for each age group and by sex (intuitive); easy to
                    differentiate the total
                    population size with bar chart; good for comparison because the age distribution was on the same
                    axis instead of
                    different charts</li>
                <li><b>Didn’t work well</b>: should have made side by side bar chart for men and women for the same year
                    to make easier comparisons
                    between sex; horizontal axis made it more difficult to compare the two years (could have done age
                    axis vertically to
                    compare more easily across all metrics [age and sex and years]); should have included axes labels
                    for population instead
                    of labels on the bars themselves; needed more consistency in positioning of labels</li>
                <li>Interested in exploring the having all four categories (male 1900, female 1900, male 2000, female
                    2000) on the same
                    graph to be able to compare population size between sex AND Year more easily</li>
            </ul>

            <figure>

            <p>
                Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> I wanted to capture trends in age distribution by sex more easily for each respective year by
                    plotting points for each
                    respective category (male 1900, female 1900, male 2000, female 2000) on one. This allows the points
                    to create a clearer
                    trend pattern to compare each category with the other sex by year categories.</li>
                <li><b>Worked well</b>: easy to see the trends between male and female age distribution for each year
                    and for comparison between
                    years (could quickly compare the difference in population size), population on x-axis made it clear
                    what the size of the
                    population per age group was.</li>
                <li><b>Didn’t work well</b>: need different color choices (some of the colors were too similar and
                    didn’t really stand out against
                    their counter parts); not super accurate due to x-axis set up (making each major tick a space of
                    1,000) and due to point
                    size; Age(0-90) going from smallest to largest on the y-axis was kind of difficult to read because
                    the trend is falling.</li>
                <li> I want to explore the differences in population size between sexes for each age group; basically
                    exploring which sex had
                    a larger population for each age group. </li>
            </ul>

                Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> I wanted to capture a different perspective on the trends seen in graphs one and two; I wanted to
                    show the difference in
                    population size between sexes for each respective year and for each age group while having a similar
                    graph set-up as the
                    pseudo population pyramid from sketch 1. I wanted to see which sex had a bigger population per age
                    group in each year.</li>
                <li><b>Worked well:</b> transforming the data so that I only had the difference in population size (i.e.
                    how many more males than
                    females or vice versa) helped show trends in age distribution in a novel way; the layout and having
                    the y-axis be age
                    was helpful to compare the two years on either side of the axis; easy to see differences in sex
                    population difference
                    between 1900 and 2000 (how many more of each sex there were by year); good color contrast.</li>
                <li><b>Didn’t work well:</b> may not be super intuitive what I mean by population difference, but I also
                    didn’t want to spell it
                    out for the audience (so I included some clarification above the key); age going from 0-90 may not
                    be super conventional
                    for the audience to understand difference over the life course (kind of backwards); don’t see the
                    overall change in
                    population size between the two years.</li>
                <li> Seeing the difference in population size by sex for each age group was helpful in thinking about
                    why there might be more
                    men than women in certain age groups, and also how this has changed from 1900 to 2000; I would like
                    to further explore
                    the difference in population size of each sex group compared to the total population overtime.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>

            <p>
                When working through the three designs, I quickly found that there were things I liked more about some
                designs than the
                others. For Sketch 1 I liked the colors I used to represent sex categories, and how it was a relatively
                easy graph to
                read to compare sex categories between the two years, however, there were style choices I would have
                done differently
                such as make the age bar be vertical instead of horizontal (so it was more like a population pyramid),
                and putting the
                bars for female and male for each age group next to each other to be able to compare more easily for
                each respective
                year. The next sketch (dot graph) does a good job of being able to compare the four categories between
                each other for
                both population between the same sex over time, but also to compare the difference between the different
                sexes for the
                same year. Sketch 2 had some limitations when it came to color choice and accuracy, as well as intuition
                of making the
                age go from smallest to largest, but it was more helpful than Sketch 1 in seeing trends in age
                distribution between the
                different sexes and comparing between the two years. Sketch 3 was a great way to visualize this idea of
                difference
                between sexes for each year and effectively did this through the transformed data (difference between
                populations of
                males and females for each age group), the clear contrast in colors, and the layout which mimics a
                population pyramid
                but is a nice way to compare the difference in sex category with larger population between the two time
                periods.
                However, I wasn’t sure again about how intuitive or well I explained the idea of comparing the
                difference in population
                size, nor if making the age (y-axis) 0-90 was also logical for folks, but that does go with the
                conventions for
                population pyramids. I want to continue to explore difference in population size compared by sex for
                each year (which
                pulls from both Sketch 2 and more specifically Sketch 3) while still being able to see individual age
                distributions
                (similar to in Sketch 1 and more so Sketch 2) and being able to compare these between the two time
                periods.

            <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

            <p>
                For the final graphic I wanted to create a design that showed not only the age distribution trend for
                males and females
                respectively, but also a design that allowed for comparison in population size between males and
                females, and between
                the two time periods. To answer the question fully, I knew I wanted to take aspects of my part 1 graphs
                (such as showing
                the total populations) to see overall trends in age distribution, as well as playing with the formatting
                to pull out
                interesting elements (like difference in size between the sex categories). I liked the initial colors I
                chose to
                represent men and women since they were bright and contrasted well (without falling into the trope of
                blue and pink)
                making it easier to read for the audience, so I wanted to keep that element in my final design.
                Additionally, I wanted
                to get age as the x-axis so the potential confusion in logic for age direction for the reader was
                eliminated; to the
                same vein, in making the population the y-axis the reader can see the scale of difference in population
                size better than
                they could if it were reversed.</p>

            <p> I intentionally removed the stacked function for the area plots so that the graphs for age distribution
                overlaid and so
                the blue area represents the population size both graphs share, and the difference (which sex had a
                larger population)
                peeked out on top. Not only does it emphasize the differences in population size by sex between the two
                time periods
                (which shows that women lived much longer compared to men in 2000 than in 1900) but also how these
                differences changed
                over time and became much more apparent. These style choices I made such as in the colors and the type
                of graph make it
                much more clear the age distribution trend between the two time periods as well. I think a few
                challenges in this final
                design were not being able to make a respective population axes for each year so there wasn’t so much
                room in the 1900
                chart (potentially obscuring the data), but this also allows for a better comparison between the
                difference in
                population size by sex for each age group between the two years. Additionally, to make it clear to the
                audience what the
                blue area in the overlaid area plots represents, I had to annotate the graph which makes it a little
                less visually
                appealing in my opinion, but provides a clarity I wouldn’t have been able to get otherwise (which avoids
                confusion for
                the audience and potential misunderstandings of the data). I think the age distribution trends by sex
                are a bit obscured
                (or at least more difficult to read on first glance) in my final design however, it does show a very
                clear distinction
                between the larger population for each age group by sex which is what I wanted to represent.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>

            <p>
                During this process, I felt that my sketches from part 1 had a huge influence on my decision making in
                part 2. I knew
                that I wanted to show the full age distribution trend between both years, but after looking at the data
                in Sketch 2 and
                noticing some huge differences between the population of males and females, I knew I also wanted to
                represent the
                difference between them like I did in Sketch 3. While I didn’t necessarily transform the data manually
                like I did for
                Sketch 3 (subtracting one population from the other to get the difference for each age group for that
                respective year),
                by overlaying the area plots I was able to visually see the difference between the population of males
                and females for
                each age group for each year. Also by playing around with the axes in my previous sketches, I was able
                to decide what
                seemed more logical for the audience (especially around how we read ages), and decide how to show the
                scale of the age
                distribution more accurately. I think that without prototyping my design, I would have just done
                something that seemed a
                bit basic or over-done. By sketching and then creating the final design I was able to decide what data
                was important for
                me to show (i.e. general age distribution compared by year) as well as how to show interesting data
                findings (i.e.
                difference in male and female populations for each age group by year). I feel like this is a helpful
                exercise that I
                plan to continue doing moving forward in my data visualization journey.
